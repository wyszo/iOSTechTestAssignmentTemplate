Overview: 
---------

If completing the assignment takes more than 8h, please stop working on it and send us an incomplete solution. 

The assignment should be send back as a zip archive. 


Guidelines: 
-----------

Please don't use external libraries for networking and TableViews. Other libraries can be used as needed. 

The code needs to be written in Swift. 

If you're applying for a senior position, please remember about unit tests. 


Requirements: 
-------------

1. The app opens to homepage - a tableView. Each cell consists of a thumbnail image to the left and a title text on the right. 

2. The app should download items to display from: 
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?_limit=50`

3. Pressing any of the cells should push a new ViewController containing full size image at the top and a title underneath. 

4. The app should only fetch the first 50 elements from the API, no need for paging or displaying more. 


Good luck!
